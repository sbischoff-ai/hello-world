Hello World!
## Vision:
To make the most complicated and laborious Hello World Project ever, trying to utilize every language I know.
## Condition:
* Each language is represented by ONE program or script.
* One script or program call via console must suffice to run all scripts/programs and must result in the words **"Hello World!"** being shown on the screen.
* Each language has to make a meaningful contribution to the result, where 'meaningful' is a term to be freely interpreted (extra points for unnecessary calculations and algorithmic overkill).
